# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is a static TicTacToe site deployed to GitHub Pages. There is no
backend service or secret material to access. Security reports should therefore
focus on vulnerabilities in the static assets, build tooling, or repository
configuration.

## Scope

* In scope: client-side vulnerabilities in the published site, supply-chain
  risks in the build pipeline, or misconfigurations affecting GitHub Pages
  hosting.
* Out of scope: server-side exploits, data exfiltration attacks, or other
  findings that require backend access or secrets (none exist for this project).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report potential vulnerabilities by opening a new security advisory via
GitHub's Security tab for this repository. If you prefer email, contact the
maintainers at `security@example.com`.

Provide as much detail as possible, including reproduction steps, the affected
URL or asset, and any supporting screenshots or logs.

## Response Timeline

* Initial acknowledgement: within 3 business days.
* Triage update with next steps: within 7 business days of acknowledgement.
* Fix or mitigation ETA: communicated once the issue is confirmed, typically
  within 30 days depending on severity and complexity.

We will keep you updated throughout the process and credit reporters in release
notes if desired.

## Coordinated Disclosure

Once a fix or mitigation is available, we prefer coordinated disclosure. We
may request that you withhold public disclosure for up to 30 days after a patch
is released to allow users time to update.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action for good-faith research that respects this
policy, avoids privacy violations, and does not disrupt the live site.
